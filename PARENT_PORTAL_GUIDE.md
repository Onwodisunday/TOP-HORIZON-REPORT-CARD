# Parent Portal Guide

## Overview
The Parent Portal allows parents and guardians to access their child's termly report cards without logging into the teacher dashboard. It provides a simple, search-based interface.

## How to Access
1. **From the Login Page**: Open the application (`index.html`). At the bottom of the login form, click the link **"Check Student Result (Parent Portal)"**.
2. **Direct Link**: Navigate directly to `parent.html` in your browser.

## For Teachers: Ensuring Reports are Accessible
For a student's result to appear in the portal, the following must be done:
1. **Create the Report**: Fill out the student's report card in the Teacher Dashboard.
2. **Admission Number**: Ensure you enter the **Admission Number** in the new input field (next to "No. in Roll"). This provides a unique ID for searching.
3. **Save**: Click "Save Report". This saves the data to the browser's local storage for that class.

## For Parents: Checking a Result
1. Open the **Parent Portal**.
2. **Select Class**: Choose the student's class from the dropdown list.
3. **Enter Details**: Type the **Student's Name** or **Admission Number**. The search is flexible (e.g., searching "John" will find "John Doe").
4. **Click "Check Result"**.
5. If found, a list of available reports (e.g., First Term, Second Term) will appear.
6. Click on a specific term to view the full Result Card.
7. Click **"Print / Download PDF"** to save physically or digitally.

## Troubleshooting
- **"Student not found"**:
  - Ensure the correct Class is selected.
  - Check the spelling of the name or Admission Number.
  - Ask the teacher if the report has been created and saved on this device (data is stored locally on the device where it was created).
